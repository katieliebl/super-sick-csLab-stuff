TThe plugin seems like it
would be very useful for when you are beginning a large programming project because it forces
you to think about classes and data members in the most abstract way possible. This helps you in
the long run because your project will be overall more organized and more modular. Although it may
take some getting used to, it seems like it's a very useful tool to help you plan out a project.
Its simplicity seems very conducive to quick and easy planning, although I do wish it separated the
auto-generated code more.
Compared to my own code, it is a lot
simpler and neater, and it contains less information and no methods. It probably would be more
confusing than useful to use if you had already started coding and adding methods and data members.
It is also really useful that it's integrated with Eclipse via the plugin.
